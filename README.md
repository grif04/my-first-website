# My Very First Website

Welcome to my very first website. 

## About
The website is an introduction to HTML and CSS and the use of links to 
navigate back and forth through different pages. It also played part to the 
introdcution to the CLI (Command Line Interface) and the use of that to back up
files locally through GIT and upload to REMOTE GitHUB. :)
